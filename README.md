# workshopdev-omnistack11
Basic programming course by RocketSeat to devs participating OmniStack Week 11.0

This is the result of the course to beginner programmers to help with the OmniStack Week 11.0.

In this project, we built a web application that helps people during the COVID-19 quarentine, giving suggestions on what to do at home.

The user can access the website and post a new suggestion. Suggestion cards will be available for anyone to see.

For this project we used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, databases and other tools.
